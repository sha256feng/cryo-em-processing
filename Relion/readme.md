# Use Relion to process the micrograph data  

## A quick start from tutorial  
  The Relion tutorial is the quickest way to kick away cryo-EM micrograph processing, which can be downloaded here [https://hpc.nih.gov/apps/RELION/relion30_tutorial.pdf]. Working through all the steps as much as you can will bring you closer to this encryptic cryo-EM data processing. For me I used Relion 3.0.5, while this tutorial is for Relion 3.0, there is some discrepency between the software GUI and the tutorial.  
  
  There are certain features of the Relion 3.0 tutorial that I would like you to know before starting:  
- **Alwalys hold on to click "Run" button. Wait!**  
As lines later you would find it says "it may be a good idea to give this job an alias like LoG_based" while you have runshed to run it with default 'job37'. This is not a big deal in term of the results, since it's only about naming. But it can impair your follow-up with the tutorial, as you may have different names for the files.
